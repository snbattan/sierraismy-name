# Sierra's Website

This is Sierra's website to display to the world whatever she pleases while learning new technologies!

This will be an iterative process. Get ready for a bumpy ride :nerd_face:

## Getting Started

Run the development server and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to enjoy!

```bash
bun dev
```

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load the custom Google Fonts Montserrat and Shadows Into Light Two.
